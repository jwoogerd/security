This repo contains work done for Ming Chow's Computer Security class at Tufts
University. My favorite assignment was the Capture the Flag exercise, in which
we used our knowledge of common vulnerabilities and exploits to find flags
hidden in a web application. This assignment was quite fun and it was amazing
to see just how easy it can be to break into a system.

Coming into this course I didn't really have much of a background in security,
so I found most of the material really eye-opening and valuable. I think the
most important thing I learned is that, as a developer, you can never trust
user input -- it should always be scrutinized and sanitized. Careful attention
to this can prevent injection and XSS attacks, which can range from being 
embarrassing to entirely crippling to your system.

 Now that I have finished the course, I would love to learn more about 
 cryptography and cryptocurrency.
