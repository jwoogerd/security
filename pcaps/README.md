Assignment 1: Packet Sniffing  

###Set 1
---

1. There are 1,503 packets in this set.
1. Protocol: FTP (on port 20)
1. FTP is insecure because your credentials and all transferred files are sent to the server in plaintext. Therefore, anyone intercepting network packets can read your username and password and reconstruct the files.
1. A secure alternative to FTP for file transfer is SFTP, which uses an underlying SSH tunnel to transfer the files.  With SSH, all communication is encrypted. (Source: http://engineering.deccanhosts.com/2013/02/why-is-ftp-insecure.html)
