\title{Biocryptography \\ {\large The Future of User Authentication?}}
\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
In traditional cryptography, authentication relies on some sort of shared knowledge,
usually a secret password or token. In today's wired world, these types of password
authentication systems are pervasive -- however, they face several fundamental
problems, chief of which that they cannot distinguish between genuine users and
attackers using stolen credentials. Biometric systems solve these problems by 
using physical characteristics to uniquely identify genuine users. However, 
these systems come with their unique set of vulnerabilities.

At the intersection of biometrics and traditional cryptography 
lies biocryptography, which fuses the strengths of both types of 
authentication systems. This project explores the state-of-the-art strategies 
in biocryptography to provide systems that are both accurate and robust to attacks.

\section{Introduction}
In traditional cryptography, authentication relies on some sort of shared knowledge,
usually a secret password or token. In today's wired world, these types of password
authentication systems are pervasive -- however, they face several fundamental
problems, chief of which that they cannot distinguish between genuine users and
attackers using stolen credentials. Additionally, users are forced to manage 
multiple accounts with multiple passwords.  \\
Biometric systems solve these problems by using characteristics like fingerprints,
irises, even ear shape to uniquely identify genuine users. However, these
systems come with their unique set of vulnerabilities: what happens if a user's
biometric data is compromised? A password can be easily reset...but a fingerprint
certainly cannot. At the intersection of biometrics and traditional cryptography
lies biocryptography, which fuses the strengths of both types of authentication systems.
This paper explores the state-of-the-art strategies in biocryptography to
provide systems that accurately authenticate genuine users and are robust to 
traditional biometric attacks.

\section{To the Community}
    \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Why I chose this topic
    Frustration with current state of user authentication systems
    Curiosity: are biometric systems as seen in popular culture (e.g. \textit{Minority Report}) feasible? Creepy? Legal? "Better" than current traditional authentication systems?
    \item Why is this important?
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item We already have a problem with password management (or lack thereof)
        \item The problem with password breaches is only going to get worse
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Traditional Cryptography}
    \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Brief overview of cryptography
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item General idea and definitions
        \item Private-key encryption and AES
        \item Public-key encryption
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Shortcomings
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Knowledge such as passwords and PINs can be easily forgotten (some stats about the average number of passwords people have to manage?)
        \item Passwords and PINs can be guessed using social engineering or dictionary/wordlist attacks (stats about breaches, etc?)
        \item Tokens like key or cards can be stolen or misplaced
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
