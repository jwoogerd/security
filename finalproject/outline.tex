\section*{Biocryptography: The Future of User Authentication?}
\begin{enumerate}[I.]
\item Introduction
\item To the community
    \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Why I chose this topic
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Frustration with current state of user authentication systems
        \item Curiosity: are biometric systems as seen in popular culture (e.g. \textit{Minority Report}) feasible? Creepy? Legal? "Better" than current traditional authentication systems?
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Why is this important?
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item We already have a problem with password management (or lack thereof)
        \item The problem with password breaches is only going to get worse
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Traditional methods in cryptography and their shortcomings
    \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Brief overview of cryptography
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item General idea and definitions
        \item Private-key encryption and AES
        \item Public-key encryption
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Shortcomings
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Knowledge such as passwords and PINs can be easily forgotten (some stats about the average number of passwords people have to manage?)
        \item Passwords and PINs can be guessed using social engineering or dictionary/wordlist attacks (stats about breaches, etc?)
        \item Tokens like key or cards can be stolen or misplaced
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Traditional areas of biometrics and their shortcomings
     \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Brief overview of biometrics and biometric systems 
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item General idea and definitions
        \item Fingerprint systems
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Shortcomings 
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Accuracy, security, and privacy challenges
        \item Biometric system attacks
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Biocryptography methods and applications
    \begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item General overview and template protection
    \item Fingerprint Fuzzy-Vault Algorithm
    \item Others?
    \end{enumerate}
\item Conclusion
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Implementation}: I plan to use a cheap fingerprint scanner or fingerprint images to implement a proof-of-concept biometric system using the Fuzzy-Vault algorithm to encrypt fingerprint data.
