### Assignment 2: Incident Alarm with Ruby and PacketFu
___

1. Are the heuristics used in this assignment to determine incidents "even that good"?  
Credit card false positives.

2. If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?

For the most part, I am fairly confident that I have implemented all aspects of the log analysis correctly. If I had more time, I would... 
When doing live analysis, I report an Nmap scan just once (i.e. when port 80 is scanned), not for each packet sent for the scan.

I talked very briefly with Inbar and Andrea about this assignment. I have spent about 8-10 hours working - mostly learning Ruby, familiarizing myself with the PacketFu libary, and grappling with regex.

*I'm using one token for this assignment -- now due Wednesday, October 8th at midnight.*
