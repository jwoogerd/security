### Assignment 2: Incident Alarm with Ruby and PacketFu
___

To do:

- report just once for packets to all ports
- test credit card info in the clear? 

- test log file analysis
- shell code protocol?
- check shell code regex   

---

1. Are the heuristics used in this assignment to determine incidents "even that good"?  
Credit card false positives.

2. If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?

---

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not. When doing live analysis, I report an Nmap scan just once (i.e. on the first port scanned), not for each packet sent for the scan.

I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment (so far). I have spent about 8-10 hours on this assignment.

*I'm using one token for this assignment -- now due Wednesday, October 8th at midnight.*
